$person = New-Object -TypeName PSCustomObject
$person | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "FirstName" -Value "Hani"
$person | Add-member -MemberType Scriptmethod -Name "greeting" -Value {Write-Host "Hello!"}
$person.greeting()

An example using Hashtables - same thing as above, less work and code is easier to read
$person = [PSCustomObject]@{
  Name = "Hani"
  Age = 24
}
$person | Get-Member -MemberType NoteProperty
